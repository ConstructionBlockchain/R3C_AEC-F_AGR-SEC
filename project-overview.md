Stakeholders:

Special Purpose Vehicle
Lenders
Security Trustee (Our Team)
Contractor
Off takers
Shareholder 1
Shareholder 2

Our objective is to create a CorDapp to replicate the actions of the Security Trustee.

The functions of a security trustee are to act as a custodian for the following:

Loan Agreement (From the Lenders)
Security Agreements from the SPV
Direct Agreements from Off Taker and Contractor

You will notice that we are not actually ‘producing’ any documents, all the docs above are supplied to us from other stakeholders, we simply acts as a custodian for the loan agreement, security agreements and direct agreements.

However we did agree to take on the security agreements, so we should attempt to replicate a security agreement but as a smart contract.  That contract would be sent from the SPV to the security trustee.

I am pasting some research below:

What is a Security Trustee?

A security trustee is the entity holding the various security interests created on trust for the various creditors, such as banks or bondholders. This structure avoids granting security separately to all creditors which would be costly and impractical.

How does project finance work?

What is limited recourse Debt?

Non-recourse financing means the borrowers and shareholders of the borrower have no personal liability in the event of monetary default.

The most visible characteristic of project finance is that it is non-recourse debt as to individual shareholders, including the project sponsors.
